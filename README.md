# phonology
Parser for phonology notation

Takes traditional phonological notation and renders into into machine-readable code. 
[+stri] --> [-stri] / [+C, + son, -cont]

Phonological rules can then be collected into a database, then prioritized or temporized. Ultimately, such a database would constitute the series of phonological changes in a language over time. The first sample will be the historical phonology of Old Saxon following rules established by James E. Cathey (UMass Amherst).
